My journey began with a profound passion for understanding the intricate workings of the human brain, leading me to complete my Ph.D. in neuroscience. I developed a deep appreciation for the power of data-driven insights during my PhD. I anticipate leveraging my research experience to pursue my passion to solve complex data problems, now in a broader and more versatile context.
