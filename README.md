## Experience & skills acquired

**Postdoctoral Associate**  *Baylor College of Medicine*  *Houston, Texas, United States*  *2021-present*
- Studying how action timing is achieved by motor programming. 
- Developing methods to analyze high-dimensional data to study magnetic sensing in free-moving birds. 
- Developed and presented an LSTM neural network to predict performance based on the initial state.

**Course Projects**
 -Extensive experience studying datasets and producing actionable business insights and strategic recommendations. 

**Unsupervised Learning**.
- Analyze the stocks data, grouping the stocks based on the attributes provided, and sharing insights about the characteristics of each group.
- **Skills & Tools Covered**: **EDA, Kmeans Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Cluster Profiling**

**Model Tuning**
- "ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of wind energy using machine learning and has collected data of generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. The objective is to build various classification models, tune them, and find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generator could be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators can be brought down.
- **Skills & Tools Covered**: **Up and downsampling, Regularization, Hyperparameter tuning**
  
**Ensemble Techniques**
- Analyze the data of Visa applicants, build a predictive model to facilitate the process of visa approvals, and based on important factors that significantly influence the Visa status recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied.

**Supervised Learning - Classification**
- Analyze the data of INN Hotels to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.
- **Skills & Tools Covered**: EDA, Data Pre-processing, **Logistic regression**, Multicollinearity, Finding optimal threshold using **AUC-ROC curve**, **Decision trees**, Pruning

**Supervised Learning - Foundations**
- Analyze the used devices dataset, build a model that will help develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices, and identify factors that significantly influence the price.
- **Skills & Tools Covered**: EDA, **Linear Regression**, Linear Regression assumptions, **Business insights and recommendations**

**Business Statistics**
- This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.
- **Skills & Tools Covered**: Hypothesis Testing, **a/b testing, Data Visualization, Statistical Inference**

**FoodHub Order Analysis using Python**
- The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to draw some actionable insights for the business. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business.
